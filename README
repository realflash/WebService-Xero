WebService-Xero

VERSION 0.13

Inspired by the Xero endorsed Ruby API Library https://github.com/waynerobinson/xeroizer/ 
and the CPAN Net::Xero module,
this Perl module aims to simplify integration with the Xero API.
WebService::Xero modules primarily encapsulate the OAuth (v1.0a) access control.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


PERL MODULE DEPENDENCIES

NB: People report that they are unable to install the dependency  Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA from CPAN which
    can be due to missing ssl libraries which can be installed as follows:

  apt-get install libssl-dev ## for debian etc
  yum install openssl-dev    ## for RH,Centos, Ubuntu etc

On AWS Linux you may need to install perl-XML-SAX using the package manager ````sudo yum install perl-XML-SAX perl-XML-Parser````



TESTING AGAINST A LIVE APPLICATION

To run tests against a live Xero Application API endpoint you need to
configure the XERO_TEST_CONFIG environment variable to point to a 
configuration file containing required credentials. See the test_config.tpl 
for a starter.
The perform a make test as per the installation and your credentials will be
included in testing.
